### What I learned

I learned how to use Google fonts from the API in addition to downloading them, using nesting methods in CSS, setting text wrapping and width, and component layout and positioning such as using flex, justify-content, and place-items.

### Continued development

From this project, I found several things that I will develop either for similar projects or others such as using grids for more complex layout structures, maximizing the use of semantic HTML, setting the layout, width, and height of components more efficiently, sizing images more responsively, deepening the use of units in CSS that fit the needs, learn more about .md for documentation.


### Useful resources

- (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) - It helps me to discover the meaning, the usage, and the best practice value structure of CSS codes that are not commonly used, not familiar, or make sure I'm using t correctly like custom CSS props, text, flex, alignment, etc.
- [Font](https://fonts.google.com/) - helps me find the correct font and the [documentation](https://developers.google.com/fonts/docs/css2) helps me understand for each unfamiliar part of the API and use the font correctly.
